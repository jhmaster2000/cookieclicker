**This is not a formal license document, do not take it literally, common sense is expected.**

This project is **based on Cookie Clicker's original source code made by [Orteil](http://orteil.dashnet.org
), with full credit for the base code going to them**, and therefore this project works under the many different license statements of the original project scattered through the files. The contents of the lines containing those license statements will not be touched (but their line positions might).

Below is provided a list quoting some, but not necessarily all, of the original license statements in some of the files.

### index.html
```
Code and graphics copyright Orteil, 2013-2022
Feel free to alter this code to your liking, but please do not re-host it, do not profit from it and do not present it as your own.
```
* Under open interpretation, for the purposes of this project, it will be assumed that "re-host" refers to running it on a website as opposed to hosting the source files. This interpretation is supported by other mirrors/modifications of Cookie Clicker's source code which have not had action taken against them in the past.

### DungeonGen.js
```
Orteil's crappy dungeon generation library, 2013
Unfinished and buggy, use at your own risk (please credit)
http://orteil.dashnet.org
```
* Essentially MIT license.

**All other files without a license statement are assumed under the "main" license specified on `index.html`.**

**As an exception to the above, the following files are 100% original to this project and not based on Orteil's files, as such they are licensed under MIT:**
* `main.d.ts`
* `package.json`
* `package-lock.json`

## Third Party
The following files are not licensed by Orteil but other third parties:
* The file `excanvas.compiled.js` is provided by Google Inc. under the Apache-2.0 license (as stated in the file as well)
