**This is not a formal license document, do not take it literally, common sense is expected.**

This project is **based on Cookie Clicker's original source code made by [Orteil](http://orteil.dashnet.org
), with full credit for the base code going to them**, and therefore this project works under the many different license statements of the original project scattered through the files. The contents of the lines containing those license statements will not be touched (but their line positions might).

Below is provided a quote of the original license statement in the main file, `index.html`.
```
Code and graphics copyright Orteil, 2013-2022
Feel free to alter this code to your liking, but please do not re-host it, do not profit from it and do not present it as your own.
```
* Under open interpretation, for the purposes of this project, it will be assumed that "re-host" refers to running it on a website as opposed to hosting the source files. This interpretation is supported by other mirrors/modifications of Cookie Clicker's source code which have not had action taken against them in the past.

**All other files without a license statement are assumed to be under the "main" license specified on `index.html`.**

**As an exception to the above, the following files are 100% original to this project and not based on Orteil's files, as such they are licensed under MIT:**
* `README.md`
* `main.d.ts`
* `package.json`
* `package-lock.json`
* `.gitignore`
* `.eslintrc.json`
